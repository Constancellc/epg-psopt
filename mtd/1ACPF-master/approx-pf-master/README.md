S. Bolognani and S. Zampieri, "On the existence and linear approximation of the power flow solution in power distribution networks", to appear on IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 2015. doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2395452

- paper.m generates the data and the plots that have been used in the paper.
- scenarios.m generates extra data and extra plots for a number of practical scenarios.
- techreport.pdf provides a discussion of the data and plots generated by scenarios.m

Simulations are based on a modified version of the IEEE 123 test feeder, which is available as a MatPower case file in the MatPower directory.

- The original IEEE 123 test feeder is available at http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pes/dsacom/testfeeders/index.html
