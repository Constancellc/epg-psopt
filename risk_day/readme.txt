cpf = continuation power flow

=== Main scripts:
Three scripts:

find_distrb.m
Create a gamma distribution for analysis

find_lin_model.m
Finds linear models, lienarised around a suitable loading point. Must be uncommented to get working, as this tends to have quite a a bit of overhead.

run_lin_model.m
Funs the linear models, to check the total power going through the transformer.

=== ./figure_scripts
plt_cpf.m
cpf as continuation power flow. Used to plot figures (apparently) for risk day, showing the voltage and loss error.
