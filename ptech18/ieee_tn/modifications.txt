Things to get the networks into a form for voltage linearization.

First: copy a version of the script, rename as *_z.dss.


======
I: linearize_manc_py.py
Here we mostly need to reorder so that the _y version 

1. reorder things (next to sourcebus first; loads/caps to end)
2. Change 3ph delta loads to 3x1ph loads
3. Change loads to constant power (if wanted) and fix voltages

If regulators, go to II.
--------
Ia: create the *_y_z file:

4. make sourcebus -> sourcebus_y in downstream element to remove
5. remove all loads/caps as required

If there are no regulators, this is then complete.

======
II: fixed_voltage_testing
We need to insert an additional line to connect the meter to to get the elements downstream, ie

b0--Reg--b0r 
to
b0--Reg--b0r0--Line+meter--b0r.

For each regulator X,
6. Change regulator secondary bus to *r0
7. Add a switch (line) from *r0 to *r, called line.X (e.g. new line.X bus1=634r0 bus2=634r phases=3 switch=true)
8. Before Add a new meter at the substation: new energymeter.msub element=transformer.sub
9. Add a new meter for each regulator: new energymeter.mX element=line.X

Return to Ia.
